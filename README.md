# pymaceuticals-challenge

In this challenge I merged two csv files together and cleaned the merge up to remove duplicates. I then created a summary statistics table on the tumor volume column. From then I began creating graphs either using the data from the original data frame, or by creating new data frames and then using that new data. All code and output is in the Pymaceuticals folder along with my analysis in a seperate README file.
