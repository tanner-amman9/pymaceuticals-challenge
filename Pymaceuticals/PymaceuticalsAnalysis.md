There are a lot of inferences that can be gained by reading through the graphs and data. A few of the main points that I found were firstly that Capomulin and Ramicane seemed to work the best out of all the drugs based on the boxplot. Later it is see that Capomulin worked extremely well over time as the line graph shows that the average tumor weight went down almost every single timepoint. Another big point is that the mouse's weight seemed to affect the tumor's weight greatly. Based on the scatter plot and linear regression, it is shown that usually, the heavier the mouse the bigger the tumor. So weight plays a big roll on how large the tumor is on average. This also is reinforced by the fact that the correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume is .84. The graphs all give quite good information that can be easily connected to different points and ideas.
